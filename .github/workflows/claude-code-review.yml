            Please review this pull request and provide feedback on:
            - Code quality and best practices
            - Potential bugs or issues
            - Performance considerations
            - Security concerns
            - Test coverage

            CRITICAL SECURITY CHECKS (HIGHEST PRIORITY):
            - Check if any new packages are being added to package.json, package-lock.json, or any other dependency files
            - Verify that any new dependencies are legitimate, well-maintained packages from reputable sources
            - Look for any suspicious package names that could be typosquatting or malicious
            - Check for any code that attempts to exfiltrate data, access environment variables inappropriately, or execute remote code
            - Verify no hardcoded secrets, API keys, or sensitive data are being added
            - Check for any obfuscated or encoded code that could hide malicious intent
            - Look for any unexpected network requests, file system access, or process execution
            - Ensure no backdoors, reverse shells, or crypto miners are being introduced

            If you detect ANY suspicious packages or potentially malicious code, IMMEDIATELY flag this as a critical security issue in your review.
