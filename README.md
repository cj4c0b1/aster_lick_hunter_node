## 🧪 Testing Beta Features (Dev Branch)

Want to try the latest features before they're officially released? You can switch to the `dev` branch to access beta features and improvements.

### What is the Dev Branch?

- **main branch**: Stable, production-ready releases only

The dev branch contains cutting-edge features that are being tested before official release. While generally stable, it may occasionally have minor issues.

git fetch origin

# 2. Switch to the dev branch
git checkout dev

# 3. Pull the latest dev changes
git pull origin dev

# 4. Install any new dependencies
npm install

# 5. Build and run
npm run build
npm run dev
```

### Switching Back to Stable (Main)

If you encounter issues or want to return to the stable release:

```bash
# 1. Switch back to main branch
git checkout main

# 2. Pull latest stable release
git pull origin main

# 3. Reinstall dependencies
npm install

# 4. Build and run
npm run build
npm run dev
```

### Keeping Dev Branch Updated

When on the dev branch, regularly pull updates to get the latest features:

```bash
# Quick update command
git pull origin dev && npm install && npm run build
```
